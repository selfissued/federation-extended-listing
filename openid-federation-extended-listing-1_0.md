.# Abstract

This specification acts as an extension to the [@OpenID.Federation]. It outlines methods to interact with a given Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple entity statements along with associated details in a single request.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The extending listing endpoint has been created to address two outstanding issues identified in [@OpenID.Federation].

## Response Size

The standard `federation_list_endpoint` has limitations when entities are able to issue entity statements for an exceptionally large number of entities. Limitations can be encountered both when attempting to process receiving such a large response as well as more technical limitations such as response sizes of infrastructure. Pagination has been proposed as a solution for this.

## Bulk Retrieval

For certain usecases, such as mass registration, consumers may encounter challenges when attempting to retrieve information on multiple entities. A flow with the standard `federation_list_endpoint` may involve a request to the list endpoint followed by a series of subsequent requests to retrieve an entity statement for each listed entity resulting in an N+1 operation. The extended listing endpoint seeks to solve this by providing a mechanism to include additional metadata for entities in the provided list.

## Requirements Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Terminology

This specification uses the terms "Entity Identifier", "Subordinate Statement", "Trust Anchor", "Intermediate", "Federation Entity", "Entity", "federation_list_endpoint", and "Immediate Subordinate Entity" as defined in [@OpenID.Federation], "NumericDate" as defined in [@!RFC7591].

# Extended Subordinate Listing Endpoint

The extended subordinate listing endpoint is exposed by Federation Entities acting as a Trust Anchor or Intermediate. The endpoint lists the Immediate Subordinate Entities about which the Trust Anchor or Intermediate issues Subordinate Statements.

While similar to the `federation_list_endpoint`, the extended list endpoint provides pagination of the result, extensive details about Immediate Subordinate Entities, and flexibility in the definition of custom filters.

This endpoint is particularly valuable in scenarios where a federation contains one or more Intermediates that manage a large number of Immediate Subordinate Entities. To efficiently handle potentially large datasets, the endpoint incorporates pagination functionality. This allows clients to retrieve the data in manageable chunks.

By segmenting the data into pages, the endpoint facilitates the efficient transmission and processing of data and also adds to the client's ability to navigate through the information. As pagination enables consumers of this endpoint to retrieve a section of the larger superset of data, some form of ordering on the response MUST be established by the issuing entity. No recommendation is made on which key the ordering is based upon and is left up to the choice of implementing entities.

The selected pagination type offers a mix of consistency and performance characteristics appropriate for the intended use of the endpoint. The size of the dataset does not impact performance. Changes made to previously fetched pages do not affect the overall result consistency, while any changes in pages yet to be fetched will be reflected in the overall result list.

The endpoint is accessible via the `federation_extended_list_endpoint` URL, which is published in the `federation_metadata`.

## Extended Subordinate Listing Request

This endpoint follows the same rules that are defined in the `federation_list_endpoint` regarding client authentication, HTTP methods used, and the way parameters are passed.

The endpoint accepts all parameters defined in the `federation_list_endpoint` in addition to the parameters defined in the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Availability** | **Type**          | **Value**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# Federation Entity Property

In order for entities to advertise the new endpoint, a new property has been defined adding to the existing set of Federation Entity Metadata as defined in [@OpenID.Federation].

| **Metadata**                      | **Availability** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| federation_extended_list_endpoint | OPTIONAL         | The extended list endpoint as described above. All constraints and restrictions on the listing of this endpoint are identical to that defined for the `federation_list_endpoint` as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0
