.# Abstract

This specification acts as an extension to the [@!OpenID.Federation]. It defines a mechanism to interact with a given
Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple
Subordinate Statements along with associated details in a single request.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The Federation Extended Subordinate Listing endpoint has been created to address two outstanding issues identified
in [@!OpenID.Federation].

## Response Size

The `federation_list_endpoint` as defined in [@!OpenID.Federation] has limitations when an Entity has a large number of
configured Subordinate Entities. In this scenario, practical limitations can be encountered both for consumers
attempting to process such large response sets and more technical limitations with infrastructure limits when returning
exceptionally large datasets. This document defines a form of pagination to address this.

## Bulk Retrieval

For certain use cases, such as mass registration, consumers may encounter challenges when attempting to retrieve
information about multiple Entities. A flow with the standard `federation_list_endpoint` may involve a request to the
list endpoint followed by a series of subsequent requests to retrieve a Subordinate Statement for each listed Entity
resulting in an N+1 operation. The Federation Extended Subordinate Listing endpoint seeks to solve this by providing a
mechanism to include additional metadata for Entities in the provided list.

## Requirements Notation and Conventions

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Terminology

This specification uses the terms "Entity Identifier", "Subordinate Statement", "Trust Anchor", "Intermediate", "
Federation Entity", "Entity", "federation_list_endpoint", and "Immediate Subordinate Entity" as defined
in [@!OpenID.Federation], "NumericDate" as defined in [@!RFC7591].

# Extended Subordinate Listing Endpoint

The Federation Extended Subordinate Listing endpoint is exposed by Federation Entities acting as a Trust Anchor or
Intermediate. The endpoint lists the Immediate Subordinate Entities about which the Issuing Entity can issue Subordinate
Statements.

While similar to the `federation_list_endpoint`, the `Federation Extended Subordinate Listing Endpoint` provides both
pagination of the result, optionally extensive details about subject Immediate Subordinate Entities, and flexibility in
the definition of custom filters.

This endpoint is particularly valuable in scenarios where a federation contains one or more Intermediates that manage a
large number of Immediate Subordinate Entities. To efficiently handle potentially large datasets, the endpoint
incorporates a pagination capability. This allows clients to retrieve the data in manageable chunks.

## Pagination

By segmenting the data into pages, the endpoint facilitates the efficient transmission and processing of data and also
adds to the client's ability to navigate through the information.

The selected method of pagination offers a mix of consistency and performance characteristics appropriate for the
intended use of the endpoint. Primarily, the size of the dataset does not impact performance. Additionally any changes
made to previously retrieved pages do not affect the overall result consistency, while any changes in pages yet to be
fetched will be reflected in the overall result list.

### Ordering

As pagination enables consumers of this endpoint to
retrieve a subset of the full dataset, the issuing Entity MUST ensure consistent ordering is implemented across all
returned responses. No recommendation is made on which key the ordering is based upon and is left up to the choice of
implementing Entities.

The endpoint is accessible via the `federation_extended_list_endpoint` URL, which is published in the issuing Entity's
`federation_metadata`.

### Response Limits

This endpoint defines the `limit` query parameter, allowing consumers to specify a desired maximum number of Entities
returned in a given response set. However, this number may, in some cases, be impractical or not feasible for the
issuing Entity to return. To address this, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations define a practical upper limit for the
response size that can be served. This defined limit MUST be set to a value that ensures if no limit is specified in a
request, or if the implementation deems the requested limit impractical, the response can be returned successfully with
all requested additional parameters.

## Extended Subordinate Listing Request

This endpoint follows the same rules that are defined in the `federation_list_endpoint` regarding client authentication,
HTTP methods used, and the way parameters are passed.

The endpoint accepts all parameters defined in the `federation_list_endpoint` in addition to the parameters defined in
the table below.

| **Parameter**    | **Availability** | **Type**          | **Value**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# Federation Entity Property

In order for Entities to advertise the Federation Extended Subordinate Listing, a new property has been defined adding
to the existing set of Federation Entity Metadata as defined in [@!OpenID.Federation].

| **Metadata**                      | **Availability** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
